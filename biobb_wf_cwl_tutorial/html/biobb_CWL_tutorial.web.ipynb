    "## CWL workflows: Brief Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Common Workflow Language (CWL)** is an open standard for describing analysis **workflows and tools** in a way that makes them **portable and scalable** across a variety of software and hardware environments, from workstations to cluster, cloud, and high performance computing (HPC) environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CWL** is a community-led specification to express **portable workflow and tool descriptions**, which can be executed by **multiple leading workflow engine implementations**. Unlike previous standardisation attempts, CWL has taken a pragmatic approach and focused on what most workflow systems are able to do: Execute command line tools and pass files around in a top-to-bottom pipeline. At the heart of CWL workflows are the **tool descriptions**. A command line is described, with parameters, input and output files, in a **YAML format** so they can be shared across workflows and linked to from registries like **ELIXIR’s bio.tools**. These are then combined and wired together in a **second YAML file** to form a workflow template, which can be **executed on any of the supported implementations**, repeatedly and **on different platforms** by specifying input files and workflow parameters. The [CWL User Guide](https://www.commonwl.org/user_guide/index.html) gives a gentle introduction to the language, while the more detailed [CWL specifications](https://www.commonwl.org/v1.1/) formalize CWL concepts so they can be implemented by the different workflow systems. A couple of **BioExcel webinars** were focused on **CWL**, an [introduction to CWL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfQb1HJWRac) and a [new open source tool to run CWL workflows on LSF (CWLEXEC)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jSTZMWtPAY).\n",
    "\n",
    "**BioExcel building blocks** are all **described in CWL**. A specific **CWL** section in the **workflow manager adapters** [github repository](https://github.com/bioexcel/biobb_adapters/tree/master/biobb_adapters/cwl) gathers all the descriptions, divided in the different categories: io, md, analysis, chemistry, model and pmx (see updated table [here](http://mmb.irbbarcelona.org/webdev/slim/biobb/public/availability/source)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we are going to use these **BioExcel building blocks CWL descriptions** to build a **CWL** biomolecular workflow. In particular, the assembled workflow will perform a complete **Molecular Dynamics setup** (MD Setup) using **GROMACS MD package**, taking as a base the **Protein Gromacs MD Setup** [Jupyter Notebook tutorial](https://github.com/bioexcel/biobb_wf_md_setup). \n",
    "\n",
    "No additional installation is required apart from the **Docker platform** and the **CWL tool reference executor**, as the **building blocks** will be launched using their associated **Docker containers**.  "

    "Writing a workflow in CWL using the **BioExcel building blocks** is possible thanks to the already generated **CWL descriptions** for all the **building blocks** (wrappers). A specific **CWL** section in the **workflow manager adapters** [github repository](https://github.com/bioexcel/biobb_adapters/tree/master/biobb_adapters/cwl) gathers all the descriptions, divided in the different categories: io, md, analysis, chemistry, model and pmx (see updated table [here](http://mmb.irbbarcelona.org/webdev/slim/biobb/public/availability/source)).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Example**: Step 1 of the workflow, download a **protein structure** from the **PDB database**. The building block used for this is the [Pdb](https://github.com/bioexcel/biobb_io/blob/master/biobb_io/api/pdb.py) building block, from the [biobb_io](https://github.com/bioexcel/biobb_io) package, including tools to **fetch biomolecular data from public databases**. The **CWL description** for this building block can be found in the [adapters github repo](https://github.com/bioexcel/biobb_adapters/blob/master/biobb_adapters/cwl/biobb_io/mmb_api/pdb.cwl), and is shown in the following notebook cell. Description files like this one for all the steps of the workflow are needed to build and run a **CLW workflow**. To build a **CWL workflow** with **BioExcel building blocks**, one just need to download all the needed description files from the [biobb_adapters github](https://github.com/bioexcel/biobb_adapters/blob/master/biobb_adapters/cwl). \n",
    "\n",
    "This particular example of a **Pdb building block** is useful to illustrate the most important points of the **CWL description**:\n",
    "* **hints**: The **CWL hints** section describes the **process requirements** that should (but not have to) be satisfied to run the wrapped command. The implementation may report a **warning** if a hint cannot be satisfied. In the **BioExcel building blocks**, a **DockerRequirement** subsection is always present in the **hints** section, pointing to the associated **Docker container**. The **dockerPull: parameter** takes the same value that you would pass to a **docker pull** command. That is, the name of the **container image**. In this case we have used the container called **biobb_io:latest** that can be found in the **quay.io repository**, which contains the **Pdb** building block."

For information about the science behind every step of the workflow, please refer to the **Protein Gromacs MD Setup** Jupyter Notebook tutorial.

For that, the complete **workflow description** should be written to a file (e.g. BioExcel-CWL-MDSetup.cwl), the **YAML** input should be written to a separate file (e.g. BioExcel-CWL-MDSetup-job.yml) and finally both files should be used with the **CWL tool description reference implementation executer** (cwltool). \n",

    "It is worth to note that as this workflow is using different **BioExcel building block modules** (biobb_io, biobb_model, biobb_md and biobb_analysis), so the **Docker container** for each of the modules will be downloaded the first time that it is launched. This process **could take some time** (and **disk space**). Once all the **Docker containers** are correctly downloaded and integrated in the system, the **workflow** should take around 1h (depending on the machine used).\n",
